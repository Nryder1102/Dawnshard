        <FaqItem question="Can I link an account to save my progress across devices?">
          Yes, if you follow the prompts to link an account in-game, you will be
          taken to the <a href="https://baas.lukefz.xyz">BaaS website</a>, also
          developed by LukeFZ. This is a drop-in replacement for the Nintendo
          account linking system from the original game, which uses entirely new
          credentials. If you create a new account and link it to your
          game&apos;s account, you will be able to access your progress from
          another device linked to the same account.
        </FaqItem>
        <FaqItem question="Do I have to start over, or can I recover my progress?">
          Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to recover your progress from
          the original servers. However, it is possible to import a save using
          the aforementioned account linking system. If you log in to a linked
          account, you can upload a JSON file with save data to be applied to
          the server. You can use a preset save file, such as this{" "}
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17pR_hZtjIZ7NKBMUjtiY355FCM_-TqgO?usp=sharing">
            maxed out save file
          </a>
          , to skip parts of the game you do not want to play again.
